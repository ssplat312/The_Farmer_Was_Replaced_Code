# The Farmer Was Replaced Code
This code is to solve all of the problems in the game "The Farmer Was Replaced".

# Maze Code Limit
For the maze times parameter in the main code, a good a mount is between 1 and 300. The reason I say this is the builtin measure function doesn't work during the first attemp and after 300 attemps. The drone will still eventually find the treasure after you found it 300 times, but it will take a lot longer to do so.

# Future Updates
The code in the Snake_Code file could be a lot better. I might update it in the future.
